<h1> Galaxies and The Universe</h1>

<p>"<b>Galaxies</b> consist of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust, all bound together by <b>gravity</b>. The largest contain trillions of stars and can be more than a million light-years across. The smallest can contain a few thousand stars and span just a few hundred light-years. Most large galaxies have<b> supermassive black</b> holes at their centers, some with billions of times the Sun’s mass.</p>

<p><b>Galaxies</b> come in a variety of shapes, mostly<b> spirals and ellipticals</b>, as well as those with less orderly appearances, usually dubbed irregular.</p>

<p>Most galaxies are between <b>10 billion and 13.6 billion years old</b>. Some are almost as old as the universe itself, which formed around<b> 13.8 billion</b> years ago. Astronomers think the youngest known galaxy formed approximately <b>500 million years ago.</b></p>

<p>Galaxies can organize into groups of about <b>100 </b>or fewer members held together by their<b> mutual gravity</b>. Larger structures, called <b>clusters</b>, may contain thousands of galaxies. Groups and clusters can be arranged in superclusters, which are not gravitationally bound. Superclusters, empty voids,<b> “walls”</b> of galaxies, and other large-scale structures make up the cosmic web of matter in the universe.</p>


<p><b>SOME DIFFERENT TYPES OF GALAXIES</b></p>
<ul>
<li type=round><b>Elliptical galaxy</b> have shapes that range from copletely round to oval consisting almost entirely of old stars. They are less common than spiral galaxies and represent nearly <b>33%</b> of galaxies in the universe </li>

<li type=round><b>Spiral galaxies</b>. Our own galaxy and the <b>Andromeda</b> galaxy are typical, large spiral galaxies characterized by<b> circular symmetry, a bright nucleus sorrounded by a thin outer disk, and a superimposed spiral structure</b>. Spiral galaxies are often seen as the most striking and recognizable with their <b>spiral arms</b>.</li>

<li type=round><b>Irregular galaxies</b> are galaxies that <b>do not have a distinct regular shape</b>, unlike a spiral or en elliptical galaxy. They have lower masses and luminousities than a spiral galaxy and often appear <b>disorganized</b></li>. 

<li type=round><b>The Magellanic Clouds</b> are irregular galaxies that share <b>a gaseous envelope</b> and lie about <b>22 degrees apart in the sky near the south celestial pole</b>.They appear to have some <b>spiral structure</b>, but it appears to have been disrupted by <b>Milky Way Galaxy</b>.</li>

<li type=round><b>Andromeda Galaxy</b> is named after the <b>mythological Andromeda princess</b>, it was originally named the <b>Andromeda Nebula</b> and is categorized or cataloged as <b>Messier 31, M31 and NGC 224</b>. Andromeda is one of the few <b>visible</b> to the unaided eye, appearing as milky blur thus located about<b> 2,480,000 light-years from earth</b>.</li>

<li type=round><b> Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy </b> is a <b>small, irregular galaxy with a billion solar masses</b>, and one of our closest neighbours. Its overdensity may lie closer at <b>25,000 light-years</b>.</li>

<li type=round><b>Comet galaxy is a spiral galaxy located 3.2 billion light-years from earth</b>. They found Comet Glaxy's parent cluster,<b> Abell 2667</b>, to have a <b>redshift of 0.2265</b>, implying a distance of over <b>3 billion light-years</b>.</li>
   
 

<h2>Our Milky Way</h2>

<p>Our home galaxy is called the<b> Milky Way</b>. It’s a spiral galaxy with a disk of stars spanning more than<b> 100,000 light-years</b>. Earth is located along one of the galaxy’s spiral arms, about halfway from the center. Our solar system takes about<b> 240 million years</b> to orbit the Milky Way just once.</p>

<p>From our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a <b>faint, milky band of light arcing across the entire sky</b>, which is how it got its name. This feature marks the central disk of our home galaxy seen edge on.</p>

<p>The Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over <b>50 </b>other galaxies called the<b> Local Group</b>. Its members range in size from<b> dwarf galaxies</b> (smaller galaxies with up to a few billion stars) to <b>Andromeda, our nearest large galactic neighbor</b>.

<b>The Local Group sits just off the edge of the Virgo cluster and is part of the Laniakea supercluster</b>.</p>

<p><b>Our universe has different more other galaxies mostly found by the most accurate telescope, The Hubble Space Telescope that helped us discover so many more substances ou there making us more certain of what lies beyond. This only proves how beautiful our universe is.</b></p>
