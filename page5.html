<h1> The planets!</h1>
<h3> What is a Planet?</h3>
<p><b> A planet is:</b></p>

<ul>
<li type=round><b>a</b> - it must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighbourhood, the Sun)</li>

<li type=round><b>b</b> - it must  be big enough to have enough gravity to force into a spehrical shape.</li>

<li type=round><b>c</b> - it must be big enough that its gravity has cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b> Our solar System has 8 beautiful planets divided into two groups- inner plantes or terrestrial planets and outer planets or jovian planets based on their composition accordingly</b></h3>

<p><b>Inner planets or Terrestrial planets:</b></p>
<ul>

<p><b>1. Mercury:</b></p>
<li type=round>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and is the closest to the Sun.</li>
<li type=round>A day on Mercury is longer than a year, meaning it takes Mercury longer to rotate on its axis than it does to orbit the Sun.</li>

<li type=round>Mercury's craters are named after artists, musicians, and authors</li>

<li type=round>Mercury is still shrinking due to its molten, iron core cooling down</li>

<p><b> 2. Venus:</b></p>

<li type=round>Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, with an average surface temperature of 462°C (862°F)</li>


<li type=round>Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, creating a runaway greenhouse effect.</li>


<li type=round>A day on Venus is longer than its year (243 Earth days to rotate, 225 Earth days to orbit).</li>

<li type=round>Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty</li>

<p><b> 3. Earth:</p></b>

<li type=round>Earth is the only planet known to harbor life.</li>



<li type=round>Earth's atmosphere protects us from meteoroids and radiation from the Sun.</li>

<li type=round>Earth has a unique chemical composition, unlike any other planet in our solar system.</li>



<li type=round>Earth's magnetic field protects us from harmful solar radiation.</li>

<p><b> 4. Mars:</b></p>
<li type=round>Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons</li>

<li type=round>There have been more missions to Mars than any other planet.</li>


<li type=round>Mars has a thin atmosphere, making it very cold and dry.</li>


<li type=round>Mars has polar ice caps made of water ice and carbon dioxide ice.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Outer planets or Jovian planets:</b></p>

<ul>
<p><b>1. Jupiter</b></p>
<li style=round>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a mass more than double that of all the other planets combined.</li>


<li style=round>Jupiter has a Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for over 300 years.</li>

<li style=round>Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, which is the strongest in the solar system.</li>



<li style=round>Jupiter has more than 95 moons.</li>

<p><b>2. Saturn</b></p>


<li style=round>Saturn is famous for its prominent ring system, which are made up of ice and rock particles.</li>

<li style=round>Saturn has more moons than any other planet in the solar system.</li>



<li style=round>Saturn is the second largest planet in our solar system.</li>


<li style=round>Saturn's moon Titan has a dense atmosphere and liquid methane lakes and rivers.</li>

<p><b>3. Uranus:</b></p>


<li style=round>Uranus rotates on its side, with a nearly 90-degree tilt from the plane of its orbit.</li>


<li style=round>Uranus is an ice giant, composed of water, methane, and ammonia.</li>

<li style=round>Uranus has faint rings and 28 small moons.</li>


<li style=round>Uranus was the first planet discovered with the aid of a telescope.</li>

<p><b>4. Neptune:</p></b>

<li style=round>Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun.</li>

<li style=round>Neptune has the fastest wind speeds in the solar system.</li>



<li style=round>Neptune is an ice giant, similar to Uranus.</li>

<li style=round>Neptune has a Great Dark Spot, a storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</li>
</ul>

<p><b> These eight planets are the wealth and pride of our galaxy showing how perfectly each planet and its characteristics resemble the extraordinary life and colorfulness of our galaxy</b></p>
