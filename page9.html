<h1>Astronomers and their discoveries</h1>

<ul>
<h3><b>Galileo Galilei</b></h3>

<li>Pioneered the experimental scientific method and was first to use a refracting telescope. He was an italian scientist who made significant achievements to the field of astronomy motion, strength of materials etc.</li> 

<h3><b>Johannes Kepler</b></h3>


<li>He was German Mathematician and astronomer who discovered that the earth and the planets travel about the sun in elliptical orbits. He broke free of the classical tradition in astronomy, preferring the methods of science to the thoughts of the ancient sages. He strongly defended and supported Copernicus and his theories.</li>


<h3><b>Nicolaus Copernicus</b></h3>

<li>He was a polish astronomer who put forth the theory that the sun is at rest near the center of the universe and that the earth and the other planets revolve around it, a Heliocentric universe. His idea was immensely opposed by the ancient philosophers until advanced technologies emerged and few other astronomies with their ideas supported this theory.</li>

<h3><b> Edmond Halley</b></h3>

<li>Edmond or Edmund Halley FRS was an English astronomer and the second Astronomer Royal in Britain. He made enormous contributions to almost every branch of physics and astronomy using his knowledge of geometry and historical science. He is best known for discovering the Halley's comet.</li>


<h3><b>Edwin Hubble</b></h3>

<li>He is often called a "pioneer of the distant stars". He played a pivotal role in deciphering the vast and complex nature of astronomny. he was trained as a lawyer and was the american observational astronomer who discovered the expansion of galaxies.</li>

<h3><b>William Herschel</b></h3>

<li>He was a german-born  british astronomer, the founder of sidereal astronomy for systematic observation of the stars and nebulae beyond. he is known as the "Father of Sidereal Astronomy" to systematically examine the cosmos and discover Uranus and its two brightest moons.</li>

<h3><b>Christian Huygens</b></h3>
